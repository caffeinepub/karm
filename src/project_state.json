  "architectural_notes": [
    "Landing page must follow strict black aesthetic (#000000 / #050607), white/soft-grey typography, minimal subtle glow, glassmorphism, huge spacing, no bright colors/cheap gradients, and production-ready feel.",
    "Include smooth scroll, fade/parallax, and subtle cursor glow effects while keeping performance fast and responsive.",
    "Primary CTA: Download APK; secondary CTA: Watch demo / See how it works.",
    "CTA language should emphasize proof and entry (e.g., “Watch Proof”, “Enter KARM”) and include a cold killer sub-line under CTAs (e.g., “If you open this, you work.” / “Built for people who are done negotiating with themselves.”).",
    "Motion should be subtle and premium: reduce visible particle motion, use slow fades and cinematic scroll beats (fullscreen text moments) rather than constant obvious effects.",
    "Provide a simple, documented way to swap in user-provided links (CTAs/social) and image assets (hero/showcase) without editing multiple components (e.g., single config file or centralized constants).",
    "Remove all images and mockups from the landing page (no hero/showcase screenshot assets); rely on typography/layout/motion only.",
    "Primary CTA (Download APK / Enter KARM) must use this fixed URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFHZKQIsXB-80s6kiqhzfsKxi3s24qA7/view?usp=drive_link",

    "Hero right-side images/mockups feel like AI stock and reduce credibility; needs real screenshots.",
    "CTA buttons feel flat and not premium (missing glass depth/glow/hover behavior).",
    "Page lacks an explicit credibility/proof section and cinematic scroll beat to elevate perceived legitimacy."
