  "summary": "The diff implements a fixed Google Drive APK download handler and updates Hero/Final CTA buttons to use it, and removes AdminPanel from the main App render path. However, the repo still contains landing-page-related components described as rendering mockup images and reading image paths from localStorage, which conflicts with the “no images/mockups” requirement if those components/sections are still reachable. Additionally, several style/polish changes appear beyond the requested scope.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Remove all images and mockups from the landing page UI so the page renders with no image assets (no phone mockups, no showcase images, no UI screenshots).",
      "reason": "The diff summary indicates at least two landing-page components still implement image/mockup rendering behavior (including phone screenshots and feature mockup images). If these sections/components are still part of the landing page render tree, the landing page would still use image assets, violating the requirement/AC.",
