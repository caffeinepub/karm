  "summary": "A new AnalyticsMockSection was added and inserted immediately before AsciiKarmSection on the landing page, using existing glass styling and SnowDotsBackground. Reduced-motion support was added to SnowDotsBackground. However, due to truncation of the new section file, it is not fully evidenced that the required fake stats (with English labels and exact values) are actually rendered to the user.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Display fake (hard-coded) stats in the new analytics block: Level = 23, Karm = 82800, Habits = 4, Challenges = 24, with English labels.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the stats object is defined (level/karm/habits/challenges), but the provided truncated content does not show any JSX that actually renders the four labeled values to the page.",
