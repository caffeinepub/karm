  "summary": "REQ-1 appears addressed by forcing a dark background behind/within the FaultyTerminal hero area (HeroSection adds an explicit black layer; FaultyTerminal container/canvas get black backgrounds). REQ-2 (graceful WebGL failure fallback + cleanup behavior) is only partially evidenced via CSS; the diff summary does not show runtime detection, fallback activation, or guaranteed cleanup logic in the component code.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a graceful fallback for the FaultyTerminal component when WebGL context creation, shader compilation, or program linking fails, ensuring the hero section still displays a dark, visually coherent background instead of a white/blank screen; and ensure clean unmount cleanup regardless of init success.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only fallback styling (.webgl-fallback) but provides no evidence that FaultyTerminal.tsx detects WebGL/shader/program failures, applies the fallback class/UI, or guarantees cleanup of event listeners/animation frames when initialization fails. The TSX file is truncated and does not include any shown fallback/error handling logic.",
