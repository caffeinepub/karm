  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 are partially implemented: a new AsciiKarmSection is inserted before SocialProofSection and CultLineSection now renders an image above the heading. However, the diff does not clearly show required resource cleanup in the Three.js ASCII component, does not show the static image asset being added, and does not prove the Cult Line heading text exactly matches the required copy because it is sourced from LANDING_COPY.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The ASCIIText component cleans up WebGL/DOM resources on unmount (no runaway requestAnimationFrame; event listeners removed).",
      "reason": "The diff shows AsciiFilter adds a document-level 'mousemove' listener, but the provided/truncated code does not show any corresponding removal on unmount, nor does it show requestAnimationFrame cancellation/disposal logic.",

      "reason": "CultLineSection references a static path (/assets/generated/karm-whatsapp-card.dim_736x1472.jpg), but the diff summary does not show the image file being added to the frontend assets/public folder, so production availability cannot be confirmed from the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Cult Line heading copy uses the exact sentence case and punctuation: \"Built for people who are done negotiating with themselves.\"",
      "reason": "The heading text is rendered from LANDING_COPY.cultLine.main, but the diff does not include the landingCopy value (or show it updated) to confirm the exact required string is displayed.",
